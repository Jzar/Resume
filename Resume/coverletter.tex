\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Jacob Gordon and I am a third year software engineering student at McMaster. I am heavily
involved within the engineering community at McMaster. I am an executive member on several software related groups,
and have been a welcome year rep for 2 years now. I thrive in opportunities for public speaking and dealing with people.
Just last week I gave my first talk at a conference, and was selected to based on my strong communication skills.
As well, I have been involved in several recruitment events for McMaster already. I was asked to volunteer at the #HireMcMaster 
campaign opening event as the ECCS believed I was a student who could properly represent the software engineering community.
As well, I have participated in several events in the past year the centred around second year stream selection, 
where I represented software engineering. I work well in teams, which I have demonstrated in my work as a welcome week rep,
and as the project manager of the Artificial Intelligence Society. 

\lettersection{Why CAS Ambassador?}
I'm interested in this position as I love McMaster software engineering, and would be thrilled to advocate for it. 
Software engineering has provided me with many opportunities, and the chance to give back and tell others about my experiences 
within the faculty would be something I'd really enjoy. I volunteer as often as I can with events similar to this position, so
for me, it makes sense to tr

\lettersection{Why Me?}

As I'm involved with the community, I can provide a better sense of the CAS experience to prospective students.
I have experience from similar volunteer positions, and from my time as a welcome week rep, I have become very comfortable with 
talking briefly to many students about life within McMaster engineering, and software engineering. I love the program, and feel I would 
do a wonderful job representing it!
